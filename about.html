            </header>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Alpha Chapter of Kappa Theta Pi, Michigan’s premier professional technology fraternity. On behalf of our chapter, I am excited to welcome you to our fraternity’s website, where you can catch a glimpse of the passion and excellence that our chapter celebrates.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the nation’s first technology fraternity, Kappa Theta Pi offers brothers the support and resources to be extraordinary during their time at Michigan. Our brotherhood is centered around five pillars: professional development, alumni connections, social growth, technological advancement, and academic support. From project teams and study groups to professional development workshops and hackathons / design jams, we celebrate a culture of growth where brothers are supported and encouraged to pursue opportunities related to their passions for tech.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our chapter thrives on its diversity and would not be the same without each and every member contributing their unique experiences and perspectives. In addition to their dedication to KTP, our brothers are also student leaders for other organizations on campus, interns at a plethora of companies, research assistants, and instructional aides for their classes. During rush, we do not discriminate by school, major, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, or background; rather, we celebrate our brotherhood’s diversity and ultimately all come together united by our passion for technology.
             </p>
             <p>
                 Reflecting on my time at Michigan, my involvement in KTP has been the most impactful part of my college experience. As a collective, Kappa Theta Pi fosters a culture of excellence as professionals, brothers, and friends. In KTP, I have witnessed the growth of some of Michigan’s most brilliant and ambitious aspiring software developers, designers, consultants, and entrepreneurs. More importantly, I have been introduced to lifelong friends and connections who serve as a constant source of inspiration and always support me to be my best self.
             </p>

             <p>
                 It is my absolute pleasure to serve as KTP’s president this year and I sincerely appreciate your interest in our fraternity. On this website, you will find information about rush and our brotherhood. Enjoy and please do not hesitate to reach out to our E-Board on the contact page if you have any questions!
             </p>
             <p>
                Thank you,<br>Maya Subramanian<br>President, 2021

              Kappa Theta Pi takes pride in being the first professional technology fraternity in the country. Our members learn a plethora of skills needed to stay knowledgeable about the tech industry, as well as a strong sense of professional development for future job positions. </p>
            </p>
            <p>
              KTP was founded on January 10, 2012, with the mission to create a tech community that enthusiastic students could join. In making KTP, the founders set up a strong community that has only grown in the 8 years since its inception.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our members come from all around campus. We are designers, analysts, computer scientists, engineers, artists, entrepreneurs, economists, philosophers, psychologists, and more. What makes the KTP community strong is our shared passion for technology and our unique backgrounds meshing together as one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our alumni are part of an extensive and tight-knit network that stretches across the country. They can be found from Seattle to New York, from Silicon Valley to Detroit, in both startup companies and larger businesses. Our alumni provide valuable insight for our members’ professional development.

            <p>
              I barely knew how to code when I rushed KTP, and I didn’t believe that I would ever truly feel like a “techie”. I expected an intimidating code-bro environment, but instead I found warmth, and support from a diverse and accomplished group. After three and a half years, I can easily say that I owe my job, my best friends, and so much more to KTP.

              KTP was like another family to me during my time at Michigan. I have never been part of a community of individuals who shared similar interests as me. It allowed me to meet such wonderful people that I still talk to even in post grad life! No matter where in the country I travel, there is always someone from KTP to meet up with and just catch up!

              Above all else, KTP brought me people. It brought me people to commiserate through courses with. People to push, challenge, inspire me. People to learn, change, grow with. People to love & be loved by. The people & the ways we grew together stayed with me even now, long after graduation.
